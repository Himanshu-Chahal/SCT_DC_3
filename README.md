#  **Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier**

This project uses the **Bank Marketing dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature encoding, model building using a **Decision Tree Classifier**, and model evaluation.

# Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- **File**: `bank-full.csv`
- Contains customer demographic and campaign-related features.

# Project Description

The goal of this project is to:

- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Build and train a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- Visualize the trained decision tree.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
- Predict the outcome for a new customer example.

# Files

- `bank_marketing_project.ipynb`:  
  Jupyter/Colab notebook version with detailed step-by-step code, explanations, and plots. **Recommended for learning and understanding the workflow.**

- `bank_marketing_project.py`:  
  Plain Python script version. Use this if you want to run the code directly as a script without outputs or markdown.

- `bank-full.csv`:  
  Dataset used in this project.

# Results

- Decision tree visualization shows decision paths clearly.
- Accuracy and performance metrics included in the output.
- Hyperparameter tuning improves model performance using GridSearchCV.
